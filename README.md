## Introduction
Hi, Iâ€™m Pablo. I am a PhD student. My research is focused on the intersection between privacy and AI. My vision is to design AI-driven methods that not only respect privacy but actively enhance it, enabling trustworthy deployments of AI in sensitive and regulated environments.

In the short term, my PhD research focuses on developing a comprehensive framework to evaluate and mitigate privacy risks in AI systems. In the long term, I aim to contribute to the creation of scalable and practical privacy-preserving AI solutions.

## Research Interests:
- Privacy-preserving AI
- Generative models
- Encrypted traffic classification

## Skills
- **Languages**: C/C++, Python, JavaScript and Java.
- **Technologies**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, CUDA and IoT Technologies (e.g. Bluetooth or MQTT)
